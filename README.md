# Pathway: Your AI-Powered Learning Sherpa

## Introduction
Welcome to Pathway, where we turn the daunting mountain of learning into a series of enjoyable hikes. Picture this: an AI that's more than just a bunch of algorithms. It's your personal guide, your cheerleader, and occasionally, your gentle nudge towards achieving your learning goals. Whether you're aiming to become a coding ninja, a philosophy guru, or a business maestro, Pathway is here to plot your route to the summit.

## How It Works
Pathway uses the latest in AI technology, specifically the gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 model from OpenAI, to craft personalized learning journeys. Here's the magic behind the scenes:

1. **Curriculum Generator**: Give us your dreams (in the form of user data), and we'll give you a curriculum. Using cutting-edge AI, we analyze your learning goals, skills, and deadlines to create a step-by-step curriculum tailored just for you.

2. **Pathway Builder**: With the curriculum in hand, our AI then crafts a "Learning Pathway" document. It's not just a plan; it's a motivational compass that keeps you focused, engaged, and moving forward.

3. **Motivational Messaging**: Pathway doesn't just leave you with a plan and a pat on the back. We're in it for the long haul, sending you motivational and progress-tracking messages to ensure you stay on track towards your goals.

4. **Daily Plan Builder**: Every day's a new adventure with Pathway. Our AI constructs daily learning plans that fit into your life like that perfect piece of puzzle, keeping the journey fresh and exciting.
